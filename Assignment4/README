You can access to all the code and results in my github : 
	https://github.com/Jimmymiji/CS-4641/tree/master/Assignment4

I use a reinforcement learning simulator, it can be found in this website.
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awm/rlsim/

I forked the code from the github repository
https://github.com/theJenix/rl_sim_fork

To run the simulator, just download this folder and run the command:
java -cp rl.jar MainUI
