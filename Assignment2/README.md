My code are adapted from the github repos:<br>
    https://github.com/cmaron/CS-7641-assignments/tree/master/assignment2<br>
    https://github.com/mitian223/CS7641/tree/master/HW2


Requirement:<br>
install jython 2.7<br>
install ant<br>
install ABAGAIL <br>
    it should work if you just download this repo,if not, <br>
    make sure you have java installed and re-compile the source code in the ABAGAIL folder with ant<br>
        cd ./ABAGAIL<br>
        ant<br>
install numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, jupyter notebook<br>


Instruction:<br>
if you want to resplit the data(generate new training , testing sets)<br>
    run python bank_spliter.py<br>

if you want to run the neural network problem
    run jython ANN.py<br>
    results are in the ANN folder<br>

if you want to generate figures for neural network problem<br>
    use jypyter notebook to run ANN_PLOT.ipynb<br>
    images are in the ANN folder<br>

if you want to run the flip flop, continuous peakk, traveling salesman problem<br>
    run jython flipflop.py<br>
        jython coutinuouspeaks.py<br>
        jython tsp.py<br>
    results are in the output folder<br>

if you want to generate the plot for these problems<br>
    run python plotting.py<br>
    images are in the output/images folder<br>

And I also upload the results for my experiment. ANN_1000 strores the results when i use fewer iterations.<br>
